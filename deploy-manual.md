# 🚀 Manual Deployment Guide for Appwrite Sites

Since the CLI deployment is having authorization issues, here's how to deploy manually through the Appwrite Console.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Manual Deployment

### 1. **Access Appwrite Console**
- Go to: https://cloud.appwrite.io/console
- Sign in with your account
- Select your project: **68e99f6c000183bafb39**

### 2. **Navigate to Sites**
- In the left sidebar, click on **"Sites"**
- If you don't see Sites, it might not be enabled for your project

### 3. **Create New Site**
- Click **"Create Site"**
- Fill in the details:
  ```
  Site ID: panel-app
  Name: Kafkasder Management Panel
  Framework: Vite
  Build Runtime: Node.js 18
  Build Command: npm run build
  Output Directory: dist
  ```

### 4. **Configure Environment Variables**
Add these environment variables in the Sites settings:
```
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=68e99f6c000183bafb39
```

### 5. **Deploy Your Build**
You have several options:

#### Option A: Manual Upload
1. Your build is ready in `dist/` folder
2. In Sites dashboard, click **"Deploy"**
3. Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder
4. Wait for deployment to complete

#### Option B: Git Integration (Recommended)
1. In Sites settings, go to **"Git Integration"**
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set up automatic deployments on push to main branch
4. Push your code to trigger deployment

#### Option C: CLI with Different Authentication
If you want to try CLI again:
```bash
# Try with different authentication method
npx appwrite login
# Or use API key in different way
```

## 🔧 Build Information

Your project is already built and ready:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`

## 📁 Files to Upload

Upload these files from your `dist/` folder:

## 🌐 After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll get:

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Sites is not available:
1. Check if Sites is enabled for your Appwrite plan

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Sites dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all files are uploaded properly

## 📚 Next Steps
