## 🔐 Authentication Flow

Your application uses Appwrite's authentication system:

### How It Works

1. User visits the app → Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
2. User registers or logs in → Appwrite creates session
3. Session stored in Zustand store (`stores/authStore.ts`)
4. Protected routes check authentication status
5. Authenticated users access dashboard and features

### Authentication Files

- **Client Configuration:** `lib/appwrite.ts`
- **Auth Store:** `stores/authStore.ts`
- **Protected Route Component:** `components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Login Page:** `components/pages/LoginPage.tsx`

---

## 📊 Database Structure

Your Appwrite database (`kafkasder_db`) includes:

### Collections

1. **beneficiaries** - Beneficiary management
   - TC number, name, phone, email, address
   - Status tracking
   - Created timestamps

2. **donations** - Donation tracking
   - Donor information
   - Amount, currency, payment method
   - Donation type and status
   - Date tracking

3. **members** - Member management
   - Membership numbers
   - Contact information
   - Status and join dates

4. **aid_applications** - Aid request handling
   - Applicant information
   - Aid type and amount
   - Urgency levels
   - Assignment tracking

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Environment Variables

- ⚠️ **NEVER commit `.env` to git**
- Already in `.gitignore` by default
- Use different values for production

### Authentication

- Sessions managed by Appwrite
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting configured
- Secure storage for tokens

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't connect to Appwrite

**Solution:** Check:

1. `.env` file exists and has correct values
2. Appwrite endpoint is accessible
3. Project ID matches your Appwrite Console
4. Database ID is correct (`kafkasder_db`)

### Issue: Authentication not working

**Solution:**

1. Verify Appwrite project is active
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure cookies are enabled
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Database operations fail

**Solution:**

1. Verify database ID in `.env`
2. Check collection permissions in Appwrite Console
3. Ensure user has proper roles
