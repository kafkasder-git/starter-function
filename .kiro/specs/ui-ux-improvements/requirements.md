# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for identifying and fixing UI/UX issues (hatalarÄ±) in the Kafkasder Management System. The system currently has various user interface and user experience problems that affect usability, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction. This feature aims to systematically address these issues to improve the application's usability for non-profit organization staff, administrators, volunteers, and other users.

The improvements will focus on consistency, accessibility, mobile responsiveness, user feedback, navigation clarity, and performance perception across all 11+ integrated modules of the system.
