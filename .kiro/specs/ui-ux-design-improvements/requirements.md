# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive UI/UX improvements across the Kafkasder YÃ¶netim Sistemi, specifically targeting forms, buttons, cards, and fundamental design elements. The goal is to enhance usability, accessibility, and visual consistency while strictly maintaining the existing corporate identity and brand guidelines. All improvements must respect the current color scheme, typography, and overall design language established in the system.
