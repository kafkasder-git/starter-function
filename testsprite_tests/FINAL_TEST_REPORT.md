## ❌ Failing Tests (21)

### Why Tests Are Still Failing

Most remaining failures are due to:

1. **Missing Database Collections** - Backend collections not fully configured
2. **Missing Test Data** - No sample data for testing business logic
3. **Feature Dependencies** - Features depend on other incomplete features
4. **Configuration Issues** - Some Appwrite collections/permissions not set up

---

## 🎯 Remaining Issues & Next Steps

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. Database Collections Missing ⚠️

**Problem:** Business feature tests fail because database collections are not
fully configured

**Required Collections:**

- ✅ `beneficiaries` - Defined in appwrite.json
- ✅ `members` - Defined in appwrite.json
- ✅ `donations` - Defined in appwrite.json
- ✅ `aid_applications` - Defined in appwrite.json
- ❌ Additional collections may be needed

**Solution:**

```bash
# Deploy collections to Appwrite
appwrite deploy collection
```

#### 2. Test Data Missing ⚠️

**Problem:** Tests expect existing data to work with

**Solution:**

- Create sample beneficiaries
- Create sample donations
- Create sample aid applications
- Create sample users with different roles

#### 3. Permissions Configuration ⚠️

**Problem:** Some collections may have restrictive permissions

**Solution:**

- Review collection permissions in Appwrite Console
- Ensure admin role has full access
- Update permissions if needed

   - Create a beneficiary
   - Create a donation
   - Verify data appears correctly

### Long-Term Actions (Next few days)

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
